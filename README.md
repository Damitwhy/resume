# resume
I realise the need for a resume will soon arrive but all my skills are in construction, groundworks and plumbing. What is a resume without proofs and evidence of skill? Well in coding I'm going to work on that one.

I've started a coding institute course in full stack coding. it's teaching me something new everyday, the more I learn the more I find, this world is so full up with coders already, I dont really stand much of a chance unless I can do something cheaper and work that others wont do becouse it's a drag.

My journey on this road began april 29th 2024. Let be hopeful and see where it takes me next...
